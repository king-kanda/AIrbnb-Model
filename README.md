Random forest regression is likely to perform better than linear regression for predicting Airbnb booking prices.

Linear regression is a parametric model, which means that it assumes that the relationship between the input variables and the target variable is linear. Random forest regression is a non-parametric model, which means that it does not make any assumptions about the relationship between the input and target variables.

Airbnb booking prices are likely to be influenced by a number of factors, including the location of the property, the type of property, the amenities offered, and the time of year. These relationships may be complex and non-linear. Linear regression may not be able to capture these complex relationships, while random forest regression is more likely to be able to do so.

In addition, random forest regression is more robust to outliers and missing values than linear regression. This is important because Airbnb booking price data may contain outliers and missing values.

Overall, random forest regression is a more flexible and powerful model than linear regression, and it is likely to perform better for predicting Airbnb booking prices.

Here is a table that summarizes the key differences between linear regression and random forest regression:

| Feature | Linear regression | Random forest regression |
|---|---|---|
| Model type | Parametric | Non-parametric |
| Assumption about relationship between input and target variables | Linear | Non-linear |
| Robustness to outliers and missing values | Less robust | More robust |
| Flexibility | Less flexible | More flexible |
| Predictive performance for Airbnb booking prices | Likely to be lower | Likely to be higher |
